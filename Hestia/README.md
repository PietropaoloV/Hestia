## Context

A "ticker" is a unique symbol or abbreviation used to identify a publicly traded company's stock on a stock exchange. Each publicly traded company is assigned a specific ticker symbol, which is used to easily reference and trade that company's stock.

## Tasks

1. **UI for the Dividend Data**
   - Create a user interface (UI) to display dividend data for supported stock tickers.
   - The dividend data is stored in CSV files within the `div_info` folder.
   - The UI should have a dropdown or search bar functionality to allow users to select a specific stock ticker.
   - The UI should display graphs plotting the following data for the selected ticker:
     - Dividend yield ratio
     - Stock prices (open, close, high) for the past 2 years
   - The graphs should update dynamically when the selected ticker is changed.

2. **UI for the Company Financial Data**
   - Create a UI to display company financial data for supported stock tickers.
   - The company financial data is stored in CSV files within the `div_info` folder.

   - The UI should display a graph tracking the following financial ratios for the selected ticker:
     - Book value to share value
     - Earnings per share
     - Debt ratio
     - Current ratio
